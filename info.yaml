  how_it_works: | 
    The reflected binary code (RBC), also known as reflected binary (RB) or Gray code after Frank Gray, 
    is an ordering of the binary numeral system such that two successive values differ in only one bit (binary digit).
    For example, the representation of the decimal value "1" in binary would normally be "001" and "2" would be "010". 
    In Gray code, these values are represented as "001" and "011". That way, incrementing a value from 1 to 2 requires
    only one bit to change, instead of two (Wikipedia)
